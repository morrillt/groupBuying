ResqueSpec
==========

A simple RSpec and Cucumber matcher for Resque.enqueue and Resque.enqueue_at (from `ResqueScheduler`), loosely based on
[http://github.com/justinweiss/resque_unit](http://github.com/justinweiss/resque_unit).

This should work with `Resque v1.6.0` and up and `RSpec v2.0.0.beta.12` and up.

If you are using `RSpec ~> 1.3.0`, you should use version `~> 0.2.0`.

Install
-------

Install the gem

    % gem install resque_spec

And update your Gemfile (Not using bundler? Do the necessary thing for
your app's gem management)

    group :test do
      gem 'resque_spec'
    end

Resque with Specs
-----------------

Given this scenario

    Given a person
    When I recalculate
    Then the person has calculate queued

And I write this spec using the `resque_spec` matcher

    describe "#recalculate" do
      before do
        ResqueSpec.reset!
      end

      it "adds person.calculate to the Person queue" do
        person.recalculate
        Person.should have_queued(person.id, :calculate)
      end
    end

(And I take note of the `before` block that is calling `reset!` for every spec)

And I might use the `in` statement to specify the queue:

    describe "#recalculate" do
      before do
        ResqueSpec.reset!
      end

      it "adds person.calculate to the Person queue" do
        person.recalculate
        Person.should have_queued(person.id, :calculate).in(:people)
      end
    end

And I might write this as a Cucumber step

    Then /the (\w?) has (\w?) queued/ do |thing, method|
      thing_obj = instance_variable_get("@#{thing}")
      thing_obj.class.should have_queued(thing_obj.id, method.to_sym)
    end

Then I write some code to make it pass:

    class Person
      @queue = :people

      def recalculate
        Resque.enqueue(Person, id, :calculate)
      end
    end

ResqueScheduler with Specs
--------------------------

Given this scenario

    Given a person
    When I schedule a recalculate
    Then the person has calculate scheduled

And I write this spec using the `resque_spec` matcher

    describe "#recalculate" do
      before do
        ResqueSpec.reset!
      end

      it "adds person.calculate to the Person queue" do
        person.recalculate
        Person.should have_scheduled(person.id, :calculate)
      end
    end

(And I take note of the `before` block that is calling `reset!` for every spec)

And I might write this as a Cucumber step

    Then /the (\w?) has (\w?) scheduled/ do |thing, method|
      thing_obj = instance_variable_get("@#{thing}")
      thing_obj.class.should have_scheduled(thing_obj.id, method.to_sym)
    end

Then I write some code to make it pass:

    class Person
      @queue = :people

      def recalculate
        Resque.enqueue_at(Time.now + 3600, Person, id, :calculate)
      end
    end

Queue Size Specs
----------------

You can check the size of the queue in your specs too.

    describe "#recalculate" do
      before do
        ResqueSpec.reset!
      end

      it "adds an entry to the Person queue" do
        person.recalculate
        Person.should have_queue_size_of(1)
      end
    end

Performing Jobs in Specs
------------------------

Normally, Resque does not perform queued jobs within tests. You may want to
make assertions based on the result of your jobs. To process jobs immediately,
you can pass a block to the `with_resque` helper:

Given this scenario

    Given a game
    When I score
    Then the game has a score

I might write this as a Cucumber step

    When /I score/ do
      with_resque do
        visit game_path
        click_link 'Score!'
      end
    end

Or I write this spec using the `with_resque` helper

    describe "#score!" do
      before do
        ResqueSpec.reset!
      end

      it "increases the score" do
        with_resque do
          game.score!
        end
        game.score.should == 10
      end
    end

Note on Patches/Pull Requests
=============================

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
